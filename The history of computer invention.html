            <h1><u>The history of computer invention</u></h1>
            <h3>The Analytical Engine, invented by the British mathematician Charles Babbage between 1833 and 1871 CE, can be considered the first computer to represent modern computer hardware.<br></br>
                The analysis engine contained components similar to those found in modern computers, such as the central processing unit, in addition to memory, but these parts did not carry these labels; Babbage used to call the mill processor  while memory was called the store  Due to the scarcity of material resources, Charles Babbage's invention remained a ink on paper only without any machine being built until 1910 AD, when Charles Younger's son, Babbage  completed the construction of part of the machine, so that she was able to do some Simple mathematical operations. Computer inventions continued after that. In the period between 1936 and 1938 AD. .<br></br> 
                the German Konrad Zee]us built the first computer programmable computer in the living room of his parents, and his invention was called a uniform  and in 1936 , The so-called Turing machine was invented by Alan Turing, and this machine used some of the principles similar to those used in modern computer hardware; She used to print specific symbols on paper according to a set of logical orders. .<br></br>In 1943, Tommy Flowers invented the first electronic programmable computer under the name Colossus, and the purpose of this device was to help the British army break up encrypted German army messages. .<br></br>From 1937 AD to 1942 AD, the first digital computer was invented under the name Astana off-Berry Computer This device included more than 300 vacuum for performing numerical calculations, such as a binary counting system, and mathematical and logical calculations.</h3>
