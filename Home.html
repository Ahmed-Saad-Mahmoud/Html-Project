        <h3>In  computer architecture is a design and structure of the functional processes of the system software .<br></br>Computer architecture is the fingerprint and job description of the requirements, design and applications of different computer parts - it mainly focuses on the way the CPU performs internally for its tasks and how it communicates with the memory addresses in the computer memory known scientifically under the Computer Organization.<br></br>
            It can also be defined as the science and art design instruction set computer architecture and the selection and delivery of computer hardware   
            appropriate to create computers that match the desired performance in terms of and cost goals. .<br></br> Term computer architecture is used to denote science that studies the concepts that link the physical, physical components of a computer with the software components represented in the operating system. .<br></br>The world has known Jane Amdahl computer architecture as computer attributes (computer) properties that appear programmed in assembly language, and appear in the structuring concepts and functional models (software). The concept of computer architecture was based on the design of a set of instructions directed to local networks until the eighties of the last century, to focus on the design of the CPU and the hierarchy of the memory unit and the system of input and output and parallel operations in addition to other aspects</h3>
