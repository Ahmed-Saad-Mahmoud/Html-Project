            <h3><ol>
                <li>Building an Instruction Set Architecture ISA is an interface between computer software and hardware, and it can also be seen as the viewpoint of the device programmer. Computers do not understand high-level languages that have a few, if any, language elements that translate directly into the mother machine's operation codes. <br></br>The therapist only understands the instructions encoded in some numerical fashion, usually binary numbers. Software tools, such as compilers, translate high-level languages, such as C, into instructions.
               In addition to instructions, ISA determines which components are available on your computer for a program such as data types and records, status manipulation, and memory. </li>
               <li>Computer Organization The Computer Organization helps improve performance-based products. For example, software engineers need to know the processing power of processors. <br></br>They may need to improve software in order to get the most performance at the lowest cost. This could require a very detailed analysis of the computer organization. <br></br>For example, in multimedia decoding, designers may need to arrange for most of the data being processed in the data path faster. </li>
                 <li>The computer organization also helps plan the processor selection for a specific project. Multimedia projects may require very fast data access, while the supervisory program may need fast interruptions. Sometimes some tasks need . <br></br>
               additional components as well. For example, a computer that is capable of virtualization needs virtual memory devices so that memory for different simulated computers can still be separated. Computer organization and features also affects power consumption and processor cost. </li>
               <li>Application (Execution process) (such as Pentium, Celeron, Pentium4, Pentium Xeon, Core2) Small education and architecture group described, process machine should be designed. This is called the design and implementation process. Architectural definition implementation is usually not considered, but rather engineering design devices. Implementation This can be categorized from bottom to several steps: <ul>
               <li>Implementing logic with designs for the specific pieces in the structure of the mini system (primarily) and based on logic. </li>
               <li>Executing designs on the transistor level from the basic elements (gates, transmitters, etc.) as well as some large blocks (ALUs) that can be executed at this level, or even (partially) in the physical level, for performance reasons. </li>
               <li>Directs the actual implementation of the physical circles. The components are placed in a different circuit in the diagrams or on a board and the wires connecting them are directed.</li></ul></li>
               <li>Computer verification checks designed a whole to see if it works in all situations and timing.Once implementation begins, Proof and First Design is simulation using logic simulation. However, this is usually very slow to run realistic programs. Thus, after corrections are made, it is constructed using field models for programming a valid portal (design including). Many projects stop hobby at this point. The last step is to test the prototype integrated circuit. Integrated circuits may require several designs to fix problems </li></ol></h3>
